[1]   Why do you like to join as a Software developer?

I'm excited about using technology to solve complicated challenges because I have to work as a software engineer. 
I have a lot of experience with several programming languages, and I'm excited to use what I've learned to 
help create creative solutions. I am drawn to your organization because of its dedication to innovation, and 
I think my flexibility and hard work will complement your objectives. I'm thrilled to have the chance to support
innovative software solutions and work with a vibrant group of people who appreciate excellence and innovation.
And as a software developer there is a scope of continuous learning, which makes me a good software developer 
and consistently working on new technologies .





[2]  List top 3 softwares / tools that inspire you. Why do these tools inspire you?


Visual Studio Code : It is a very effective and useful code editor which supports most of the languages . Because of this 
this tool is preferred by maximum developers, which contains Git integration, intellisense and many more extensions useful for
specific languages .It is a user friendly tool which can be understand well by the beginners also. The main thing that inspires me is
the customisation and a good community surrounding it as they demonstarte the value of teamwork in development.

Github : A platform which encourages cooperation and open-source work, not only version control. It motivates a developer to 
monitor changes, project tracking on a global scale, and manages workflows effectively. It also helps in collaborating with other
developers and also encourages a culture of creativity and sharing information, which I find inspiring as a developer.

Docker: Docker is a platform that allows us to build ,test and deploy applications quickly. It uses containerisation for making application
deployment and scalability easier. Anyone who knows how the docker simplifies the workflow from development to deployment gets amazed.
It motivates me as a developer demonstrating how technology may improve software consistency and dependability in various contexts, which in turn
can increase the productivity of the development process.

There are so many tools and softwares which are trending nowadays but these three tools inspire me in such a way that they are essential
in day today life of a developer.And mainly all 3 of them are open source.

        •Review Display: Displayed user-submitted movie reviews, fostering user engagement and discussions.
        •CORS Handling: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for secure data exchange between the
         frontend and backend.
        •State Management: Utilized React hooks to manage application state efficiently.
        •Database Integration:Integrated MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

    Tech stack used : React , Axios, Spring boot, MongoDB

2)Department student microservice system : Developed a dynamic microservices system with Spring Cloud for independent department and student
management. Employed Eureka for seamless service discovery, Config Server for centralized configuration,
and a secure API Gateway for access control.

    Key Features:
        •Student Service: Precise student data management, including name, age, position, and department
           affiliation.
        •Department Service: Efficient handling of department-related information and student association.
        •Microservices Integration: Seamless inter-microservice communication via Eureka.
        •Centralized Configuration: Dynamic updates without interruption through Config Server.
